          A racing series founded by Jim Liaw and Ryan Sage. The first race in
          this series took place in 2003. Formula DRIFT (or Formula D) is
          considered the most popular car race in the drifting category. It is
          famous for adapting digital technology to the world of motorsports and
          is most popular among the so-called "millennial generation" (young
          people involved in digital technology).Soon, the drift association
          held a series of exhibition events across the country, which were
          aimed at promoting the series as a safe racing event. Motorsport fans
          could learn the skills of this unique car control technique under the
          guidance of the best drifters of the USA and Japan - Alex Pfeiffer,
          Calvin Vann, Andy Yen, Kenji Sakai and Hiro Sumida. The high
          popularity helped attract investors who organized various exhibition
          races. However, until June 2003, the races were chaotic and were held
          only with sponsors.
